The program analyzes a log file containing cybersecurity events and detects suspicious activities, specifically focusing on login  failures, bruteforce activities, and intrusions.It tracks the occurrence of each event type for different IP addresses and blocks 
certain IP addresses that exceed a threshold of login failures. The code also identifies repeated instances of access denial for IP 
addresses and blocks them accordingly. It provides real-time feedback by printing the detected activities, blocked IP addresses, 
and the time taken to block them.
